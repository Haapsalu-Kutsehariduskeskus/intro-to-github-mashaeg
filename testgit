# A man decides after seventy years
## That what he goes there for, is to unlock the door
#### While those around him criticize and sleep
## And through a fractal on a breaking wall
# I see you my friend, and touch your face again
##Miracles will happen as we trip
*But we're never gonna survive, unless*
*We get a little crazy*


Mis laul see on?
